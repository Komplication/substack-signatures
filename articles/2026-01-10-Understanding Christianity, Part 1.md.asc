# Understanding Christianity, Part 1

If God is perfect, then imperfect beings cannot live in His presence. Allowing imperfection into His kingdom destroys the very idea of God. That is not theology. It is logic. I used to think Christianity started with rules, doctrines, and promises. It does not. It begins with an accusation. Something is wrong with you. And you cannot fix it. I do not struggle to believe that God exists. I struggle to believe that I belong anywhere near Him. If God is perfection,¹ then my problem is not ignorance. It is not a lack of effort. It is incompatibility.

In Romans, Paul argues that everyone has sinned and that sin separates us from God. Worse, he insists there is not a damn thing we can do about it. Paul gives the solution later, but it means nothing unless we first understand the problem. And the problem is not only that all have sinned (Rom 3:23), or that sin separates us from God (Rom 6:23), or even that we cannot justify ourselves (Rom 3:20). The problem is that we are corrupted to the core (Rom 5:12).² If this is true, then this is not merely a problem. It is the most fundamental problem of our existence. And it demands our fullest attention.
  
So what is sin? And who is God?

## Who is God

What does ‘God’ mean? When people say God, we have no idea what they mean. Materialists reject a creator, yet still speak of “God” as the physical universe and all the emergent phenomena within. Others described God as the structure of reality. Deists say a God designed the universe but does not act within it, while pantheists identify God with everything that exists. Dualists use “God” to refer to mind, consciousness, or spirit. Psychological types talk of God as an archetype, the highest ordering of the psyche. Some of these views are clearly non-Christian, so you might think we can reject them outright, but Christian theology uses ideas from some of these traditions.³ So, it’s no surprise that within Christianity, no one entirely agrees on the full set of God’s attributes. We find disagreements all the way down, from denomination, congregation, family, man and wife, and within ourselves from day to day. But there is one attribute everyone who uses the word God agrees on: that God is, or describes, perfection.

We have a strange relationship with perfection. We chase it everywhere. We pour ourselves into our work, art, athletics, craftsmanship, discipline, and relationships. The pursuit itself feels instinctive, hardwired into us whether we act on it or not. Think self-improvement, music, math, or sports. We even like seeing perfection in others. Every four years, the world watches the Olympics, expecting new records. We want to see flawless execution. There are even circle drawing contests. And! People watch them! Despite our obsession with perfection, we never reach it. The music could be cleaner, the car faster, the battery longer-lasting, and the food more satisfying. In our best moments, in spite of knowing perfection is impossible, we keep aiming for it. In our worst, we violently reject the very idea of perfection.

Anger burns through us when we fail. Failure makes us feel stupid and inadequate. First, we refuse to accept it, saying: “given the circumstances, I did the best I could,” “I’m only human,” “nobody’s perfect.” Then, we resent perfection itself. Defeated by its harsh unfairness, we demand to know who’s responsible for these ridiculous standards? The test was unfair. This music is impossible to play. The hiring manager must be racist. We ask, “What kind of world is this?” Some curse God Himself and attack the ideal. Cain did this by killing Abel. God is perfect. And perfection is harsh. God’s law requires perfection, and that law is harsh.

We tell God His laws are unreasonable.  We think they should be achievable, as if God should lower the bar for us. But God is perfect. God cannot alter that about Himself. The moment God lowers the standard is the moment God ceases to be God. Perfection is His nature. We have to stop viewing the Law as punishment. It is a standard. No different than a grading rubric used to grade an essay. Think of it as a mirror. It shows us who we are and how we measure. The Law is not strictly necessary for this awareness, but it is essential for exposing sin. Paul tells us that God’s standard is written on our hearts. We know what we should do, but we do not do it. So, even without the Law, we know what we should aim for.

So, now we have some understanding of God and how we fall short, but what specifically is sin?

## What is Sin

For all have sinned and fall short of the Glory of God.

Scripture is the best place to start. It describes sin as opposition to God, a mindset against Him; as lawlessness, the transgression of God’s commands; and as a universal condition shared by all humanity. Sin manifests itself in both failing to do what God requires and actively doing what He forbids. Scripture is unambiguous on this point: sin is defiance, a rebellion against God.⁴ You could walk away from this thinking sin is simply breaking rules, but there’s something more subtle to sin.

“Sin” comes from a few different words in the bible.⁵ Both the Greek hamartia and the Hebrew chata mean to miss the mark or to fall short of the aim. Scripture further describes sin as willful violation and rebellion: the Greek anomia (lawlessness), parabasis (stepping over a boundary), and the Hebrew pesha (rebellion). As said above, God is, among many things, perfection or the highest ideal. Sin, then, is any action that does not align with that ideal, whether through weakness, neglect, or deliberate defiance. It is not just imperfection. It is a refusal to live in alignment with God. And, as said above, we don’t need the bible to see this; we find it in our lives. We regularly fall short even when we set out to achieve perfection. Further, we also actively rebel against the ideal. In the middle of the act, we feel the urge to stop, and yet we persist. We tell the lie that makes us look better. We take something that’s not ours, and hold anger longer than we should. Then there’s the letting go of the ideal (or the ideal letting go of you, Rom 1:18-20).  That is, when our hearts reach a state of open rebellion. Scripture calls this iniquity from the Hebrew avon and ungodliness from the Greek asebeia and adikia, meaning unrighteousness. Regardless of the mechanism, sin is our willful turning away from God. Why do we do this?

Luther describes sin as incurvatus in se,⁶ Latin for “curved in on oneself,” meaning the human heart turns inward. We reshape reality to put ourselves at its center. Everything we pursue is to satisfy the self rather than love for God and neighbor. In the case of open rebellion, we become our own gods, believing that we are in control of our lives; that we determine our outcomes. And this leads to tremendous suffering in our lives.⁷  In my life, self-centeredness has led to failed relationships, the inability to admit wrong, the need for recognition, blame-shifting, the constant comparison game, endless excuses, long-held resentments, and withholding forgiveness, to name a few. My self-worship has led to not only my suffering but has caused pain and suffering in others. And while that suffering is real, focusing on it misses the point. Sin brings suffering, but the real charge is this: sin defies God. That is why it stands under judgment, and why we stand guilty (Rom 1:18; 3:19; 8:7; Isa 1:2; Jas 4:4).

Sin is not only a violation of the first commandment, but also of all the other commandments. It takes root in our lives when we place our will above God’s. This is idolatry. Self-worship. Jesus summarized the Law by commanding us to love the Lord our God with all our heart and all our mind, and to love our neighbor as ourselves (Matt 22:37-40). How can a self-absorbed people do this?  Even when we speak of loving God, our love is self-seeking. Do we praise God for who He is, or because we want credit for saying the right things? Do we serve our neighbor freely, or because we expect God to notice? Do we obey out of trust, or because obedience lets us stand on something other than Christ?⁸

We seem to possess an innate awareness of God and of His perfection. Paul says this knowledge is plain to us. But awareness is not obedience, and knowledge is not love. Left to ourselves, we do not move toward God in trust, but turn inward. And because we cannot stop placing ourselves first, we fall short of the glory of God.

## Conclusion

So we arrive back where we began. If God is perfect, then we cannot dwell in His presence. Not because God is cruel, but because He is God. Our problem is not that we lack information. It is not that we have failed to try hard enough. We know the standard from birth. The Law only makes it clearer. We know what the good is, and we do not do it. Worse, we cannot stop putting ourselves first. Our nature is curved inward, and every attempt to straighten it fails.

This is what it means to say that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The problem is not merely that we break rules. The problem is that we are incompatible with a perfect God. The Law exposes this relentlessly. It strips away excuses. It closes every escape. God cannot lower His standard, and we cannot raise ourselves to meet it. That leaves only one conclusion. We will stand before God and face His righteous judgment. God will expose us for who we are. He will bring our secrets into the light. He will expose the desires of our hearts. And He will find no one righteous, no one fit to enter His kingdom. Unless something outside of us intervenes, the separation between us and God is final.
  
For the wages of sin is death.

That is the problem Christianity insists we face.

1. By “perfection,” I do not mean to reduce God to an impersonal ideal, a psychological archetype, or a symbolic highest value, as Carl Jung or Jordan Peterson seem to do. I mean the Holy and Righteous living God who creates, commands, judges, and acts in history. God is perfect, yes, but he is also much more.
2. By “corrupted to the core,” I am referring to the doctrine of Original Sin. This doctrine holds that sin is not merely a series of bad actions, but a condition inherited from Adam that affects the whole human person: mind, will, and desires (Rom 5:12-19). Christians have disagreed about the extent of this corruption, a debate reflected across Augustine, Aquinas, Luther, and many others. In this paper, I follow the basic Pauline claim that sin is universal, inherited, and inescapable by human effort. This will be the topic of a future essay.
3. Christian theology overlaps with non-biblical schools of thought, especially Greek metaphysics. For example, concepts such as essence, being, and perfection overlap with those of Plato and Aristotle, though they clearly reach different conclusions.
4. Romans 8:7; James 4:4; 1 John 3:4; James 2:9-11; Romans 3:23; 1 John 1:8; James 4:17; Galatians 5:19-21; Romans 1:25; Matthew 6:21, 24; Deuteronomy 6:5; Isaiah 1:2; 1 Samuel 15:23; Daniel 9:5
5. Lexical usage of hamartia, chata, anomia, parabasis, and pesha as reflected across the Old and New Testaments.
6. Though Luther does not consistently use the phrase verbatim, he repeatedly describes sin as the human heart turned inward upon itself, seeking itself in all things; later theologians summarize this idea as incurvatus in se. See Luther, Lectures on Romans (LW 25) and The Bondage of the Will.
7. Buddhism diagnoses suffering (dukkha) as arising from attachment and self-clinging (taṇhā, upādāna), particularly the fixation on “I” and “mine” (cf. SN 22.59). While Christianity and Buddhism radically disagree on God, creation, and salvation, both recognize that inward self-centeredness produces suffering. The similarity will be explored in a future essay, but it’s worth pointing out here.
8. Scripture repeatedly warns that religious devotion can be self-seeking rather than faithful, condemning prayer, obedience, and service when they are performed for recognition, justification, or reward rather than love of God and neighbor (Matt 6:1-5; Matt 23:5-7; Luke 18:9-14; Luke 15:29; Isa 29:13; Matt 15:8). Scripture also rebukes any attempt to stand before God on such devotion, insisting that righteousness comes apart from works of the Law and that to rely on obedience rather than Christ attempts to nullify the cross (Rom 3:21-28; Gal 2:21; Phil 3:9; Heb 10:14).
