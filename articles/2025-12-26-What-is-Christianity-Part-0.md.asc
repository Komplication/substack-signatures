# What Is Christianity, Part 0

I've always wanted to know the truth. First, I looked at what my family told me was true, God. An all-powerful creator living in heaven, watching and recording everything we do. All our thoughts. Do what I say or hell awaits. I remember sitting in Church staring up at the cross, wondering why on earth God created the snake in the first place. When the service ended, I asked one of the well-dressed decons, and I was told not to question the bible. The whole thing felt ridiculous. Sure, some of the moral claims were legitimate, but much of it seemed like a convoluted mess intended to confuse and exhaust people into acquiescence. It just didn't make sense. On top of it all, why are there so many religions all claiming to know God?

Early on in my atheism, I mainly talked with Christians about their beliefs. These were never formal debates; just late-night conversations with friends over the years. I genuinely wanted to know how they could believe such a story. Explanations varied, but I never heard a clear explanation of what Christianity is, why it is true, or why that truth matters. Often, they claimed things that were not biblical.

I found a good handful of Christians didn't fully understand their religion or its claims about reality. Most held to their faith for understandable reasons: family tradition, an experience, hope for heaven, or fear of hell. Eventually, I stopped asking. I understood their reasons, but they were the same reasons you would expect from any religious adherent, and none of them attempted to prove the underlying claims of Christianity. Years later, God revealed what I could never see. It had been right in front of me all along. Instead of equations and physical evidence, I needed to look at myself. I needed to examine human behavior.

We fail to live up to our ideals. Or, more to the point, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. These ideals are shared across the world. Regardless of religion or worldview, people recognize the value of honesty, fairness, loyalty, and love for our children. The most successful religions capture these ideals, leading to the common claim that "all religions are the same" or "different paths up the same mountain." This is false. Religions make incompatible claims about God, man, sin, and salvation. Still, the sentiment survives because it points to something real. The ideals are widely shared. The failure to live up to them is universally shared.

That's the truth Christianity uniquely tackles. I finally understood its core claim. Ideals are from God, and they are known to all. We fail to live them, even when we want to. And the fact that we want to tells us something about who we are. God created us in His perfect image, the highest ideal. But we rebel against God. This rebellion is one of our most distinct characteristics. We, on our own, can never reach the ideal. We can never walk with God. And, with this understanding, Christianity begins to make sense.

The book of Romans explains the core of Christianity. It describes the human condition and why we fail to live how we know we should. And, most importantly, it explains justification, faith, and grace. I now know it's true, but I still need to answer some of my earlier questions. Christianity is not a set of moral tips. It is a coherent set of claims about reality, and its starting point is the universal human problem that everyone knows but cannot fix: we know the good, we fail to do it. Romans shows our failure, explains why it matters, and lays out God's answer in justification, faith, and grace. This series will walk through Romans, expanding on the parts I objected to in the past or find difficult now.

Though I address these posts to Christians, they are really my notes cleaned up. One reason this series exists is simple: I do not want to become the kind of Christian I kept running into years ago, someone who believes sincerely but cannot answer basic questions about what they claim is true. Christianity makes claims about reality, and those claims must be understood. I do not want my faith, or my children's faith, to rest on habit, comfort, or inheritance alone. I need a clear grasp of Christianity, and my understanding is not there yet. I am sharing these notes in the hope they help others do the same, and to invite correction where I am wrong. I will make mistakes. I will inevitably step on toes concerning doctrine. For example, questions about original sin, which devout Christians disagree on.

None of this is new. Christianity has been disputed, refined, attacked, and defended for two thousand years. I have no intention of introducing novelty, only of understanding it honestly.

In the next post, we start where Paul starts. All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. Is that actually true?
