# Starting Assumptions

Every serious inquiry has to start somewhere. Below is where I am starting from. I am a Christian, specifically a confessional Lutheran. I did not start here. I was a committed atheist and a staunch materialist for many years. I accepted the modern assumption that reality is only matter, energy, and forces, and that anything not measurable was dismissed as subjective or meaningless. I believed this made my thinking grounded in reality. I was wrong.

Over time, I came to see that materialism is not a conclusion reached by science, but a philosophical constraint imposed on it. Materialists narrow the definition of truth so severely that entire categories of reality are ruled out before any investigation begins. This is not science, but ideology. Eventually, I could no longer hold this view without intellectual dishonesty, so I abandoned it and began following the question instead: What is true, and what does that truth demand of us? That search has taken more than a decade and led me through philosophy, psychology, theology, history, and Scripture. These essays are written from that place. They are not an attempt to win arguments or convince anyone. They are an effort to think clearly, speak honestly, and take truth seriously wherever it leads. In my case, it led me to Christ.
