# Creeds

> *"Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he."* - [Proverbs 29:18](3_Reference/Bibles/ESV%20Bible/Old/20%20-%20Proverbs/Prov-29.md#v18)

People don’t know what they believe. They espouse convictions plagued with contradiction, defend them with unmerited certainty, and remain oblivious to their conflicting beliefs (Bran, 2020). The result is a life marked by confusion, where purpose is sought through endless distractions or the adoption of perpetual causes, identities, or groups, rather than through clearly articulated beliefs. This same confusion surfaces in organizations. While organizations are initially started around a shared set of beliefs, over time those beliefs fragment. Group A advances its objectives at the expense of Group B. Local factions pursue their own priorities, lose sight of the shared beliefs that once unified them, and the organization begins to founder. This is an ancient insight: without shared creeds or belief systems, disagreements accumulate, and rationality collapses (Durkheim, 1893/1984; Thornton et al., 2012). A clear and coherent set of beliefs is necessary for both individuals and organizations. They force clarity and accountability and serve as a guiding light, but they can also devolve into tribal markers and empty recitation. This paper examines creeds at a fundamental level: what they are, why they exist, and how they fail.

## Definition
The word creed is most commonly associated with Christianity. It derives from the Latin credo, meaning *"I believe."* At its root, a creed is simply a statement of belief. In this sense, it overlaps with related terms such as confession, profession, doctrine, ideology, maxim, proverb, or oath. While these terms are not identical, each contains an explicit or implicit claim about what is true.

An oath, for example, necessarily implies belief. When one says, *"I, Michael, do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies,"* the statement presupposes the belief that the Constitution is of sufficient importance to warrant personal sacrifice, even to the point of death.

This paper focuses on the shared core of these words: *"I believe."* And, belief is not an opinion. It asserts something about what *is*, not what *ought* to be, and it changes how a person thinks, acts, and orders their life (Howe & Krosnick, 2017). A belief that is never stated, never owned, and carries no risk is hardly a belief. For this reason, the working definition used here is:

> A Creed is a public truth claim: a statement of what an individual or group believes reality looks like.

Creeds are short by design. They may require a few pages of explanation, but they are not encyclopedias. "The whole Bible" is not a creed. If it were, Christians would not splinter into countless denominations while all claiming Scripture. Creeds exist because belief must be compressed into explicit claims and defined terms. If a creed is defined too broadly, it risks losing its significance, as it cannot legitimately claim to address every aspect of reality (Religious Studies - Hartford Institute, n.d.). In engineering, you cannot verify a requirement that reads *"the system shall be good."* In medicine, *"keep the patient healthy"* is not a clinical plan. Boundaries must be defined. A creed works the same way. If it is not specific enough to be challenged, it is not specific enough to mean anything.

## What’s the Point

> *"Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth than lies."* - F. Nietzsche

### Sharpen Understanding of Reality
Internally, we carry a wide range of unexamined convictions. People readily claim allegiance to ideals such as freedom, discipline, fairness, or forgiveness, yet most have only a vague understanding of what these commitments actually entail (Bran, 2020). Research consistently shows that individuals overestimate how well they understand their own beliefs, revealing that many convictions are far less developed and coherent than assumed (Rozenblit & Keil, 2002). As a result, people often hold incompatible beliefs simultaneously, despite sincerely insisting that their views are consistent, moral, and rational (Nosek et al., 2011; Haidt, 2001).

What *ought* to be coherent is defended as though it *is*. What actually exists, however, is frequently an unexamined mixture of impulse, intuition, and inherited language. Belief that has never been articulated remains incomplete: it has not been tested against reality, sharpened by disagreement, or clarified through expression. Such convictions do not guide action so much as distort it. When belief remains this vague, it does not orient our lives, it misleads us. Creeds exist to force clarity. They compel belief into language, expose internal contradiction, and make explicit what is otherwise left implicit. In doing so, they bring belief into the open, where it can finally be understood, evaluated, and lived.

A creed forces an individual or organization to state precisely what it holds to be true about the structure of reality. Once that happens, ambiguity is no longer available as a refuge. Inconsistencies, flawed reasoning, and intellectual shortcuts are revealed, and this is precisely the point. Creeds function as a mechanism of purification, stripping away borrowed language, socially convenient postures, half-formed thoughts, and mutually conflicting claims. When a creed is made public, it invites challenge. This is uncomfortable by design. One risks error, embarrassment, and revision. *Good*. At that moment, a choice emerges: revise the creed and move closer to the truth through deliberate refinement (aka [Iterative Perfection](4_Thoughts/Writings/Iterative%20Perfection.md)), or cling to falsehood and preserve only the appearance of certainty.

Kierkegaard made it clear that unexamined beliefs remain borrowed and cannot be truly owned:

> *"There are many people who reach their conclusions about life like schoolboys: they cheat by copying the answer out of a book without having worked the problem themselves."* - S. Kierkegaard

Creeds, therefore, demand responsibility. Once beliefs are articulated and made public, scrutiny follows. Our now public claim about what reality looks like comes with risk, as the Reformers discovered during the Reformation.

The Augsburg Confession provides a useful illustration. The Reformers did not anticipate significant resistance from Rome regarding their articulation of original sin, yet Rome objected strongly. That objection required the Reformers to clarify, expand, and formally articulate their position. The creed did not resolve the disagreement, but it made the disagreement explicit and and made their view of reality plain for all to see.

### Settle Controversy
Historically, creeds are developed in response to controversy. When primary beliefs are contested, groups compile their convictions into clear, public statements so that disagreement can be settled or made known rather than left in ambiguity. This is evident across religious and institutional history. The Nicene Creed emerged out of the Arian controversy over the nature of Christ, forcing the church to articulate, in unmistakable terms, what it meant to confess the Son as *"of the same substance"* as the Father (Gonzalez, 2010).

Creeds draw lines where there were previously none. This still goes on today. When facts and norms, previously uncontested, become disputed, organizations and communities may adopt creedal language to affirm and defend their positions. For example, many religious organizations now include in their bylaws statements that marriage is between a man and a woman, drawing a boundary for themselves and the culture (Hart, 2011). In the recent past, no serious organization would have taken a position on the shape of the Earth or the nature of sex and gender, but today these facts and norms are disputed.

Secular and political organizations use creeds or analogous statements to delineate their principles and objectives. For instance, political parties draft manifestos that function as creeds, outlining ideological commitments and policy goals. These documents provide clear statements of beliefs that members adhere to and rally around. Similarly, civic organizations may issue mission statements that encapsulate their core values and purpose, guiding decision making and ensuring consistency across their initiatives.

### A Guiding Light
Over time, people forget what they believe. Not in the dramatic sense of adopting a new religion overnight, but in a quiet and insidious way. Definitions blur, priorities invert, and slogans replace long-held beliefs. What unfolds slowly in individuals happens far more quickly in organizations spread across time and space. A creed functions as a fixed reference point, a stable statement of belief that allows a community to return and say, *"This is what we meant",* even as language, leadership, and culture change. In churches, where creeds are most clearly preserved, this function ensures continuity between the faith confessed today and the faith confessed across centuries, despite changing contexts and controversies (Kelly, 1972; Pelikan, 1984).

### Teaching Next Generation
Creeds are not only written to settle disputes. They are written so that those disputes are not forgotten and repeated by the next generation. Once clarity has been achieved, allowing it to dissolve back into ambiguity would be foolish. A creed functions as a compressed record of hard-won understanding. It marks the precise point where confusion once threatened to fracture a community and states, in plain language, *"Not that. This."*

Creeds also exist because reality is complex and truth is sometimes counterintuitive. They provide the next generation with a structured starting point, a set of words that has been tested, refined, and deliberately preserved. A creed does not replace deeper teaching. It requires it. Without such a framework, children and newcomers absorb whatever is most prominent in the culture or whatever preferences happen to dominate local leadership. Creeds prevent this kind of perversion by obligating communities to continue teaching not only what they believe, but why those beliefs matter.

### Some Problems

#### Tribalism / Indoctrination

> *"I can say God, but that’s just a sound, no more potent than any other sound."* - F. Herbert

Creeds are not magic. They do not automatically improve thinking or instill belief. Shared recitation assumes shared meaning, and that is a *massive* assumption. Many people repeat words they do not understand. The language is often old, the phrasing unfamiliar, the translations sometimes muddy, and the meaning rarely explained. Terms like *"before all worlds",* from the [Nicene Creed](http://Nicene%20Creed.md), are not self-evident and require explanation. When those words are misunderstood, the creed is not being confessed, but recited blindly. At that point, it is little more than an empty sound. Mindless repetition may make it feel more true, but it is not actually guiding anyone toward the truth (Hassan, 2021). It trains people to confuse repetition with truth, belonging with conviction, and confidence with comprehension.

#### The Cost of Honest Examination
People may claim to believe a creed, especially when it has been recited since childhood and woven into their faith, family, friendships, and sense of belonging. They may grasp the words at a surface level, yet resist examining the claims themselves, because doing so risks discovering that they do not honestly believe them. That’s terrifying. For many, a creed is not just a statement about reality but the framework through which life has been understood. Honest examination can carry real consequences, including exclusion, loss of community, or the painful decision to leave for conscience's sake. Faced with these costs, people often avoid scrutiny altogether. They do not look closely or ask hard questions, not because truth is rejected in principle, but because the price of discovering it may be too high. This pattern of deliberate avoidance is well documented in psychology and is known as the ostrich effect, the tendency to avoid information that threatens one’s identity or commitments (Karlsson et al., 2009).

#### Holier than Thou
Even when people understand the words, a creed can still lead them away from the truth if it is used for status. In this case, the creed ceases to function as a truth claim and becomes evidence of righteousness. It is no longer something to live under, test, and suffer for, but something to hide behind. The creed turns into tribal clothing. It signals membership, purity, and moral standing. It declares, *"We are the good ones."* In this form, the creed becomes a shortcut to status and a substitute for integrity. People stop asking whether their lives conform to the confession and begin using the confession to judge others. Augustine warned against this inversion, arguing that true confession begins with self-examination rather than external theatrics (Augustine, 397). A creed only serves its purpose when it is aimed inward first. It must be fully understood, defended with seriousness, and applied where it costs something. If it never costs anything, it is not a confession. It is a costume.

#### In-Group
People sometimes claim beliefs because they sound noble, not because they are genuinely held. High ideals carry social prestige. Saying *"I believe in freedom", "I believe in equality", or "I believe in human rights"* marks a person as enlightened and safe to be around. These phrases are absorbed early, repeated automatically, and mistaken for conviction. Research on identity protective cognition shows that people often adopt and defend beliefs that signal loyalty to their social group, even when those beliefs conflict with evidence or collapse under pressure (Kahan, 2017). When a claimed belief is finally tested, when defending it costs reputation, comfort, or power, the mask slips. The person who praised free speech now demands censorship. The person who praised tolerance now treats disagreement as moral contamination. The creed was never a truth claim. It was a costume put on to fit in. This is why public statements matter. Once a belief is stated plainly and publicly, it can be challenged, compared against actions, and refined under pressure.

## Creeds in the Real World
People want to be principled. We want to be seen as holding noble beliefs and *"standing on the right side of history."* As a result, we often claim allegiance to ideals that sound virtuous long before we have tested whether we truly believe them. Creeds have a way of exposing this gap. When stated plainly, they reveal inconsistencies between what we say we believe and how we live.

Consider the widely repeated claim, *"My body, my choice."* In the West, bodily autonomy has often been treated as a moral absolute, a principle few would reject. Yet during the COVID pandemic, many who had previously affirmed this credo supported coercive medical policies enforced through job loss, exclusion, and public pressure. The contradiction revealed that bodily autonomy was not the belief it was claimed to be, but a slogan adopted under limited conditions. When the cost changed, the belief vanished.

The same pattern appears with other commonly professed ideals. Free speech is routinely described as essential to democracy, until it becomes offensive or disruptive, at which point censorship suddenly becomes justified. Science is praised as a method grounded in questioning and skepticism, until questioning becomes inconvenient, at which point dissent is treated as a moral failure rather than an inquiry. In each case, the creed collapses under pressure, revealing that it was never a truth claim but a posture.

The point is not merely to accuse individuals of hypocrisy, though hypocrisy is real. The deeper issue is that many people, and organizations (e.g., Google, *"Do no evil"*), do not hold coherent beliefs. We often claim beliefs we wish we had, or that earn social approval, rather than beliefs we are prepared to live under when they cost something. Creeds expose this reality. They strip away flattering language and force belief into the open, where it can be tested against action, refined, or abandoned. In doing so, they confront us with an uncomfortable truth: we place God, neighbor, and truth first *only* so long as it is convenient. When it ceases to be convenient, we reveal what we actually believe and who we really are.

## Conclusion
Creeds exist because people forget, distort, and rename reality.  We claim coherence while holding incompatible beliefs. We want the prestige of high ideals without the cost of living them. A creed shines light on our claims, necessarily dissipating confusion, by stating plainly, *"I believe."* It forces definition, coherence, and accountability. It draws a line against drift, ambiguity, and the gradual corrosion of meaning. 

A creed, however, is not a charm. It does nothing for those who do not understand what they are saying. Recitation without comprehension is not confession but mimicry. Even when understood, a creed can decay into a badge or a costume, a means of signaling righteousness while avoiding scrutiny. This is what makes creeds dangerous, not because they are too strong, but because they can be wielded without integrity.

The question, then, is not whether creeds are useful. They are. The question is whether we are honest enough to use them properly. A creed only serves its purpose when it is aimed inward first. It must be explainable, defensible, and livable, especially where it costs something. It must be tested publicly, refined under critique, and kept coherent with the rest of what we claim to believe.

Everyone and every organization has beliefs. Most do not know what they are. When beliefs remain undefined, they do not guide action; they mislead it. Leaving belief unstated is the easy path because it avoids challenge and accountability. The harder path is to force belief into words, accept the risk of being wrong, and allow truth to burn away what is convenient but false. If truth is the aim, a creed is one of the sharpest tools available. The final question is, *will we use creeds to move closer to the truth or to hide from it?*
